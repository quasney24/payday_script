- 'Historical' tab will show all accounts, past and present, to ensure a comprehensive historical view of prior periods that is inclusive of any accounts that are/were end-dated 12/31/9999. Will follow up with a cleaner structure of this historical piece in AAko-7837

"MITEK EI Quota - Ability to UL Zip Quotas w/ DDD # or IMS ID, Use INV Realign. to Apply Crediting Exception",AAKO-7440,1446005,Story,Open,AAKO,PAYDAY ,software,mmarsh3,,,High,,,colson8,colson8,22/May/18 1:41 PM,06/Jun/18 6:52 PM,17/Jul/18 3:54 PM,,MIT,,MIT,,Targaryen,,0,Mitek,,,,,,,"Attachment: email discussion w/ Iris

Need the ability to upload Early Intervention ZIP Quotas with a 2nd level of Customer Information:
* L1 = Zip Code (exists today)
* L2 = DDD Number (DDD Feed); IMS ID (Script Feed)

Business Reason: Like Sales, the Quota needs to take into consideration any Crediting Exceptions. For the DDD and Script feeds, this includes these DDD #/IMS ID Crediting Overrides. 

On the Sales side, this is managed via the Invoice Realignment (Overrides).

Change to Quota Upload & Geo Crediting would leverage the same process to credit, but we need the ability to UL the quotas at a lower level of detail. Expectation is that 

Example:

# ZIP = 03458; DDD Number = 1234567; IMS ID = NULL; Quota = $100,000
# ZIP = 03458; DDD Number = NULL; IMS ID = NULL; Quota = $750,000
# ZIP = 03458; DDD Number = NULL;  IMS ID = 9876543; Quota = $150,000

* Total Quota for 03458 = $1MM
* Quota w/ NULL for both goes to the regular Zip-Terr alignment
* Quota when either DDD/IMS ID is populated goes to the Crediting Exception Terr
* Cannot have both DDD # and IMS ID Populated on the same record

""Hey Bozena! 

Wanted to give you the heads up: Stark has several upcoming stories to create FSO/Analyst views of FY Quota at Current Alignment. We just had a call with Targaryen because it was originally communicated that the dependency was on their team, but just learned the dependency is on Lannister’s story AAKO-6990: Participant Credit quota for future months at processing month alignment (SD). 

Basically 30+ story points of our C.2 sprint are dependent on this story, so could you keep us in the loop as to what the table name, structure, etc is so we aren’t scrambling too much when we get to C.2? 

Let me know if you want to discuss. Thank you!

 - WWID Summary DV table would contain all records (active and inactive), but when the WWID Summary DTP posts to the WWID Summary PRM table, it should be filtered to include only the Active? = Yes records
 - Should the WWID Summary MAIN view filter out the Active? = No records and display them in a separate editable view?

hi Robbin. This is how the periods work out of the box in Optymyze. This is used across the board by all our other clients and coming off v11 the feedback is actually positive. I do wish to understand the scenario you mentioned better and hear about other scenarios, but if this is related to being able to see current and prior dynamic data months, then I believe we should have a better filter for that, using the fiscal month field. There are also options to apply more complex filtering, so I hope this is mostly related to getting more used to the Optymyze way, not sure. I wish we never go there, but just to comment on it, adding a custom configuration to add Month and Year separately, I assess that to be a huge effort - not complex, but a lot of work, considering the vast volume of views.",,,,,,,,,,,

1)	Component Earnings Adjustment Update – 
a.	Currently the Component Earnings Adjustment is based on a geography level. However we noticed that territory can change from a primary to non-primary and vice-versa during the year and hence causing duplicates in the Component earnings Adjustment process and causing the jobs failure in some months. 
b.	To cater to this we have a high level solution to introduce the Primary Geo Flag for some metrics. We can have detailed meetings to share this solution with you. 
c.	Meanwhile we propose to track this update to the process in a story – “Apply Primary Geo flag to Component Earnings Adjustment process”",,,NONE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AAKO-4906,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Done,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1|ht0idr:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AAKO - Lannister - Acadia.4,,,,13.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In V11, we have the ability to upload multiple types of sales adjustments in one spreadsheet.   The description (reason for the change) is kept at the line level.   This line level detail allows us to research any questions that may arise if there are concerns about the adjustment.

In Optymyze, the new upload template only allows for “one type” of adjustment at a time.    We need a change to the upload template that allows us to upload multiple types of adjustments on one template and allows us to add a “Comment/description/reason” to define why the adjustment was made.    The “reason” may be selected from a drop down…maybe use the existing short description field??

UPDATE per 2/12:
- Additional FORM fields, per WWID:

For background information: the managers still need visibility to the rates for their teams, across all BUs, despite the system moving to share split %. This is as a result of potential QASC or distributor changes that may happen within an account. E.g. - if a rep in a territory terms and a (salaried) QASC takes their place, the manager might need to go in and lower the team rate to accomodate. Consequently, if a participant previously had a 60% share of 11%, they may now only have a 60% share of 9%.

New Commission rate value entered will pre-populate all WWID-level commission rate fields

You're correct, it's nothing they have today because of v11 limitations, but was identified as a must-have. I'd recommend checking in with Rick, Neslie and Joe S. before deprioritizing it...mostly because when we held the analyst workshops, we'd communicated to each of the groups that they could have up to 3 critical reports developed for go-live (fortunately, there were only 2 or 3 'new' reports that came from that for all groups combined, this being one of them).

Updating View to account for:

- Once the job runs, the statement is generated and the internal analyst releases the statement, will need to automate an email and announcement to the WWID recipient notifying them that their statement is available: ""Your statement is ready to view. Click here for details.""

  - Expansion category tables (created by Targaryen in B.2 and B.3 - Pending completion on Targaryen team need confirmation before developing)
- Ensure the statement contains the Expansion Category section as detailed on the attached mock-up. 
-- Note that this includes updates for the Mgr view: only one line will be shown (primary geo) on the face of the statement, and aggregate Sales Revenue Credit will be a drill-down,...that drill-down will be filtered on only one component (to avoid duplication between both sales objective and accelerator components being displayed) and only the current active fiscal month (bc as advised by Targaryen, their tables automatically aggregate the sales revenue credit, so all prior months credit is already included within the current month)
- Since Expansion Category is only applicable to the DPS businesses, the section will need to be hidden from non-DPS participant statements
- Also include a field called ""Notes"" beneath the expansion category 
     - Legal disclaimer to include in notes section on DPS statements *only*: ""For fully commissioned sales consultants, the full commission compensation arrangement includes allocated reasonable and necessary business expenses based on a monthly allowance of $500 for automobile and $900 for other business expenses.""
     - Per refinement on 5/22: this field will be STATIC ONLY and not dynamic; if a payout analyst needs to adjust or add information, they will need to reach out to the data/systems teams to do so as a one off

This appears to be answered in the DART. Can we leverage this (both DART and Ethicon DART) for a visible report to show all FSOs (not just mgrs)? Would need to pull in participant information (WWID, name, BU).

3) Mgr views WITH Consultant WWIDS - both current and historical
4) Mgr views WITHOUT Consultant WWIDS - both current and historical

NOTE: Mgrs need two views as the WWID version will show significant duplication of records if there's more than one participant aligned to a customer. Mgrs do not know how to filter this out or remove duplicates. Views in #4 will solve by providing data similar to Views in #3 listed above - i.e., the same data, but with no WWID or consultant names included.

          (not real time), Optymyze will set-up a back-end parameter table about which valid combinations exist, and the validations will be part of the data transformation/ad-hoc job, i.e., not real-time.  Example, quota attainment cannot be set-up wtih crediting date as the ""crediting eligibility"", and the non-sales crediting metric types do no need an entry at all.  Commissions such as Net Sales * rate would be the only metric type category using ""crediting eligibility"". Crediting eligibility = crediting date ,only supports metric types that have a current period of sales, and doesn't support lookback period or a quota.

•	Report on any Participants kicked out of calculations based on Component not having Payout Curve defined for the position
     - Optymyze to develop design with having this check not be specific to a period that's being run.  Reach back out to POs if there are design limitations with that request.
     - Optymyze to double-check whether there should be additional steps for effective dated htd/ or ytd quota components.  Should it look at more than the month you're running vs open period.  (Consider the flat payment, MBOs, draws, that are metric types that don't need a curve can pass through).  Either develop a separate parameter table to store which metric types have curves OR use that from the metric type entity itself ie adding a column to that table if it uses a curve data.  

•	Report on when a Rep does not have a Primary BU or Primary Territory and has a Component aligned that requires a Primary BU/Prim Territory (i.e AUTO)

Questions discussed: 

#1 What other information should we display, besides the Sales Split %?
- FORM should contain detail currently shown on existing form: Old Rate/New Rate, Territory Share %, Plan Base %, Growth Base % [e.g. 18%-Plan base %], Growth % [The SC's allocation of Growth Base %], Plan rate %
- PENDING requests should show: WWID, Terr, Old rate/New rate

#2 Should we capture the Rationale on the data form or in the comments of the request?  Do we need both?
- Rationale to be a required field on the form

#3 Should there be any timeout conditions (i.e. if the Other RM does not respond within X number of days then escalate to the Comp Admin)?
- No timeout conditions or system-generated cancelations - cancel ability only open to requestor and comp analysts 

#4 Can they change any other fields in Participant to Geo?  Primary Geography, Geography Lead, etc?
- No changes that aren't directly related to the rate change request

#5 What communications are needed?  Should we auto-post alerts in the Announcements page of the RM?  What alerts do we provide analysts?
- Announcement on landing page when request approved, email to RM when request canceled
 

Optymyze team - assess required data structure to work with future-state Optymyze system, and copy functional use over to Payday

PENDING: Will this be leveraged for multiple BUs in Optymyze?","06/Feb/18 9:21 AM;sabdulla;[~szlockie][~choffm12][~PEdla] for this section of the acceptance criteria, I wanted to make sure we get clarifications.

* User Form - Old Rate/New Rate, Sales Split %, Plan Base %, Growth Base % [e.g. 18%-Plan base %], Growth % [The SC's allocation of Growth Base %], Plan rate %, Effective Period

*Per multiple discussions, I believe We will not need Old Rate/New Rate, Plan Base, Growth Base etc. What we will continue to have is the Rate Basis which is essentially the Growth Rate or Commission Rate based on Metric Type*

In the validation logic - records are being kicked out for product doesn't exist or customer is null but there is another reason that would have also kicked out the record.  

For example, when running UAT for Ethicon Sales.  32 records were shown with validation error that product doesn't exist in product master.  However, all 32 records also had the OPCO company code of ""AS""  -  These are invoices that fall under ASP and would have be reject for opco not ""ET"" or ""ES"".   Business analysts that would need to investigate the validation errors if they new the invoices were not Ethicon/Endo .. could ignore these validations.

Another example when running UAT is that several records were kicked out because the customer number was null/empty.  However, all of these records also had trans effct cd = 3.  This would also be an indication that the business analyst would not need to research any further.

_PS [~szlockie]: will be reaching out when we turn our focus to PI-C and Accruals. Keeping a running list of thoughts/considerations below_

Accruals - what is the expected run/refresh frequency of these?

- Finance usually asks for projected full period earnings, but this looks like ""period to date based on the data available"" without ANY projections or forecasting calculated in the system. Need confirmation of this, as it will have massive impact on scope.

If forecasting is a request from finance:
* What are Finance's business rules on forecasting out for a full period? If forecasting, how should we take into consideration the fact that Sales behaviors differ depending on a Comp Plan and whether we're at the end of a month/quarter/year (different sales patterns in that 'rush' towards the end)
* Are accruals going to be manually run, or on a schedule? If schedule, what frequency?
* How is the business planning to handle the fact that Mitek DDD, Script and Tracings sales do not arrive until Close + 10? These account for over 50% of all OV/MV sales, impacting: EI Rep/Manager (full plan); Surgical Reps (Early Intervention Commission and Early Intervention Growth)
* ","29/May/18 1:11 PM;colson8;Putting 13 as a placeholder SP, but expect this to be VERY HIGH LoE.","30/May/18 3:26 PM;colson8;Action: Cade needs to reach out to Nadia - the provided mockup feels VERY light on data. Are we sure this is really the Harmonized design (see attached)? Don't think this is correct, and Accruals RPT needs a lot more data than Commissions, CY Sales, PY Sales","19/Jun/18 10:48 AM;colson8;(flag) Flag added

Only real concern on this report is the WWID-Terr-Plan-Component level *PRIOR YEAR SALES*. 

I doubt we are WWID-crediting PY sales for all components @ current alignments, as very few plan components need it. What is the current state of this data being available for all Plan-Components?

For Ethicon, the participant to geography alignment dates that are entered in Optymyze would be set as the start and end date of the fiscal month.  So theoretically there would be no different result for Ethicon if we were to use ""end of the month"" logic vs ""crediting date"" logic.  However, if an unexpected or accidental data entry was made on the participant to geography assignment table for Ethicon such that a start or end date was mid-month, then I think a validation should be included as a kick-out because the crediting results would not be the expected results.

How we will know which line record is added? _Updated date will be blank_. If posted internally, those records will be blank.
-Attainment and Growth - 2 types, enter to 2 different collumns at front table, but at back its going to one table
Key is each metric type must update attainment entity if this metric is payout curve or not
Ensure - Period for which is being run, Ex From Jan- June data entered in July,  I know that this plan should have payut curve I need to capture for July. 
It needs to feed for that _particular month_
Based on metric period, if combination doesn't exist, we add zero $ line, or (zero attn or zero $ growth) process will not fail, whatever measure looks like give us zero value, this will ensure we are not overpaying, 
-Analyst can trace back see why it was zero and it can update payout curve accordinaly 
-Analyst can go to payout curve table, and identify audit logs
-New records will be added for only the fiscal month being processed (i.e. the start and end dates of the record being added will be the first and last day of the fiscal month being run).
Combination: Plan, Component and Position
